# MacOS Dotfiles for [@KendricNg](https://twitter.com/kendricng)

Kendric's macOS configuration dotfiles. These configurations are specific to my workflows and are meant to be used as inspiration for other developers. Feel free to pick and choose those that you may find useful.

I don't recommend you simply copying and pasting my personal configurations directly into your system. Play around with each config file and line to get an understanding of what each do.

This dotfile repository is using the dotfile management method described in this YCombinator [thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754), from which came a [blog summary](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles#installing-git-lfs) from Atlassian.

## Current Software

As I'm adding more configurations to my workstation, I'll continue adding them here.

- tmux, (neo)vim, zsh, git, pyenv, brew, starship, mill, sdkman, scala, poetry
